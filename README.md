<h1 align="center">
  Front-End Development Task for Frontier Techworks
</h1>

In this task, our intention is to test your skills as a front end designer, and for you to become more familiar with component design principles and Gatsby. You will find below a brief of how the folder structure exists and what we are looking for.

## Where to find the design

The design (both mobile and desktop) can be found in Zeplin. Please go to https://www.figma.com/file/MMO6SdYbNWd7Rx17RdVzc7/DigiVet-Project?node-id=0%3A1

The above images are screen shots of the actual desktop and mobile designs in the link given.You have to complete the first two pages as shown in the screen shot for both desktop and mobile views  by using breakpoints.(Example styling can be found in the styled.js files in the repo)

There is a multistep form,complete the first two steps as shown in the screen shot.After clicking on next button on the second step,all the details from 
step 1 and step 2 should be shown as summary page.If we click back button from second step it should show first step and the already filled details in the input boxes.

## What you will be judged on

1. Accuracy to the design and code style/efficiency.
2. Use of Styled Components
3. Responsiveness

## Component styling

To give you a reference on how to style the component, we have styled one component out of the complete design. Please check the """ to understand how component level styling works.



## How to submit the completed task

You can submit the final submission by uploading it on your personal github in a new repo and sharing the link with me on info@ftworks.de.

If you have any questions you can always contact me.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Setup a site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to start a site running.
    Follow the docs of Gatsby to Setup and running.
    [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/).

1)  **And you ready to start.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby clean
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.
